# OCSv3 Architecture

OCSv3 separates platform responsibilities from service-team implementation
details. This remains true whether a service ships in CloudRING or is maintained
in another repository.

```text
platform core
  reads module package
  mounts portal extension
  evaluates IAM/tenant access
  routes billing/support/evidence events
  reconciles lifecycle through declared Kubernetes and adapter contracts

service module
  owns CRDs/controllers
  owns service API
  owns billing connector
  owns support diagnostics
  owns portal microfrontend
  owns evidence receipts
```

The platform core depends on service metadata and APIs rather than importing a
service's internal packages. Provider integration lives behind adapter
interfaces. Reusable, source-safe adapters may ship in CloudRING; concrete
accounts, inventory, credentials, private endpoints, and installation overlays
stay in the downstream provider repository.

## Request Path

1. User selects a catalog plan.
2. IAM evaluates tenant, project, entitlement, and permission.
3. Portal renders the module extension if allowed.
4. The service controller reconciles a Kubernetes claim.
5. Billing events are emitted with idempotency keys.
6. Readiness and support evidence are recorded.
7. Denied, degraded, blocked, retryable, and ready states are visible.

No production readiness claim is valid without current evidence.
