# Legacy Goal 01 coverage bridge

This file preserves one-to-one coverage for the stable requirement definitions in
[`specifications/goal-01.md`](../specifications/goal-01.md), but it no longer
records accepted delivery status. The former Goal 01 combined
reference-installation recovery, public contracts and later platform work into
one scheduling unit; the canonical executable program is now
[`roadmap.yaml`](roadmap.yaml), with accepted state under [`state/`](state/).

Ownership is carried without weakening through
[`LEGACY_WORK_MAP.md`](LEGACY_WORK_MAP.md). Each row below names exactly one
canonical owner and the stable `CR-GNN-*` requirement against which it is now
accepted. The legacy identifier remains a compatibility alias, not a second
status or completion authority. Every row stays `unverified` until that
canonical goal publishes an exact OSS/Enterprise/Provider/hub tuple and fresh
evidence. Historical local or live observations are recovery inputs, not
readiness claims.

Requirements for the local or remote OCS runtime, dynamic microfrontends, product
moderation, offers, entitlements, quota, billing, marketplace, multi-cell operation,
and federation are not owned by Goal 01 and remain pending for later roadmap goals.
