# CloudRING implementation roadmap

This directory is the executable program for turning CloudRING into a complete,
independently operable open-source cloud platform. It replaces a single
breadth-first mega-goal with an ordered series of production vertical releases.

The intended end state is a provider platform that:

- can be installed, upgraded, operated, backed up and recovered by one engineer;
- has no single point of failure inside its declared failure domain;
- lets a mid-level developer build and operate a cloud product without changing
  platform core;
- exposes the same complete capability through API, CLI, portal and safe agent
  automation;
- runs with zero installed cloud products and accepts products only through the
  Open Cloud Standard (OCS);
- scales by adding replicas and bounded regional cells rather than by making one
  unbounded control plane;
- keeps all reusable implementation in `opencloudtech/CloudRING` and keeps only
  site, provider and proprietary bindings in downstream repositories;
- is continuously delivered to the OpenCloudTech reference installation at
  `hub.cloudring.org`.

## How to execute this roadmap

Read, in order:

1. [CURRENT_STATE.md](CURRENT_STATE.md) for the audited starting point.
2. [TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md](TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md) for durable design
   boundaries.
3. [EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md](EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md) for agent, delivery and
   acceptance rules.
4. [MEASUREMENT_CONTRACT.md](MEASUREMENT_CONTRACT.md) for reproducible SLO,
   performance, operator-toil and developer-DX proof.
5. [EVIDENCE_POLICY.md](EVIDENCE_POLICY.md) for resolvable, signed and expiring
   proof.
6. [VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md](VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md) for executable terminal
   goal QA and machine-readable verdicts.
7. [ISSUE_MAP.md](ISSUE_MAP.md), [LEGACY_WORK_MAP.md](LEGACY_WORK_MAP.md) and
   [HUB_PREREQUISITES.md](HUB_PREREQUISITES.md) for ownership and live gates.
8. [REFERENCES.md](REFERENCES.md) for the standards and primary sources used.
9. The next goal whose dependencies are all complete.

`roadmap.yaml` is the machine-readable dependency graph and compact status index.
Goal files are the normative acceptance contracts. Once a goal starts, its
detailed proof record is stored under `state/` against `state.schema.json`; proof
artifacts use `evidence.schema.json`. CI must keep the index and detailed state in
lockstep. Current SHAs and runtime facts are deliberately kept out of individual
goals so that a stale snapshot cannot become a release claim.

| G25 | [Regional cells, multi-region and measured scale](goals/G25-regional-cells-multi-region-and-scale.md) | Post-1.0: providers add bounded scale/failure units without enlarging one control plane forever. |
| G26 | [Sovereign federation](goals/G26-sovereign-federation.md) | Post-1.0: independent providers exchange approved products without shared root, database or coordinator. |

## Sequencing rule

Goals execute in the dependency order encoded in `roadmap.yaml`. The CloudRING
1.0 path ends at G27 after G24; it does not depend on G25 multi-region or G26
federation. Those post-1.0 tracks depend on the released standalone provider and
may proceed independently of each other. Research, design spikes and read-only
audits for a later goal may run early, but production implementation cannot skip
its declared dependencies. This prevents parallel scaffolds, duplicate platform
kernels and an unmaintainable partial system without making future federation a
release blocker.

Every goal must finish the same delivery chain:

`OSS implementation -> OSS main -> downstream pins -> downstream mains ->
hub.cloudring.org rollout -> live acceptance -> issue closure -> evidence`

A goal is not complete when it is only documented, locally implemented, green in
a feature branch, or present in an open PR/MR.

## End of roadmap

CloudRING 1.0 is complete only after G27 proves, from released artifacts and clean
checkouts, that independent providers can install and operate CloudRING, product
teams can build conformant local, remote and API-only services without core
changes, the required reference products work through OCS, upgrades and declared
failures preserve service, and no required capability remains a scaffold, mock,
private dependency or hidden manual step. G25 and G26 are explicit post-1.0
expansion tracks and cannot be used to weaken or substitute any standalone 1.0
requirement.
