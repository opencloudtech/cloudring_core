# G12 — Network cloud product

## Outcome

Deliver the first real, sellable reference product entirely through OCS: isolated
tenant networking with subnets, addresses, routing, security policy and external
connectivity. This is the proof that the platform kernel and product standard work
without a direct service integration.

All reusable implementation must merge into public OSS and the exact accepted
change must be deployed and live-verified at `https://hub.cloudring.org`.

## Scope

- Define OCS network resources: network, subnet, port/interface, address,
  security group/policy, router/gateway, route and external address attachment.
- Support IPv4 and IPv6, explicit address families, overlap validation, IPAM,
  allocation/release, quotas, capacity, meters and pricing dimensions.
- Implement a generic network connector and a reference Cilium/Gateway API
  adapter with provider bindings for BGP or L2 advertisement. Site routing stays
  downstream; lifecycle semantics stay OSS.
- Reconcile desired and actual state, discover drift, adopt explicit existing
  resources, reject unsafe implicit adoption and recover interrupted mutations.
- Enforce tenant isolation with network policy, anti-spoofing, least-privilege
  controller access and audit.
- Provide API, CLI and portal extension for topology, lifecycle, policy, status,
  cost, quota, capacity and troubleshooting.
- Implement HA, overload behavior, upgrade/rollback and diagnostics for network
  controllers; the data path must not depend on portal/API availability.

## Required journeys

- create dual-stack network/subnet, allocate addresses, attach ports, apply and
  update policy, establish external connectivity, meter and delete;
- prove allowed tenant traffic, cross-tenant denial, spoof denial and unavailable
  external route behavior;
- exhaust address/quota/capacity without leaked allocation;
- interrupt each lifecycle step, retry, reconcile drift and clean all state;
- fail the active network controller/node and preserve existing data-plane traffic;
- upgrade and roll back the product without losing allocations or policy.

## Hub and downstream delivery

Publish and install the signed reference network product from OSS. Enterprise
supplies only OVH address/vRack/BGP or L2 bindings. Prove direct IPv4 and IPv6
hub/API paths, origin TLS and a bounded network failover on the reference site.
CloudLinux runs the same product conformance against synthetic site bindings.

## Acceptance

- First real catalog/order/subscription/entitlement/meter/invoice chain succeeds.
- No network implementation is compiled into platform core.
- Current Task 23 networking defects and false-readiness paths are closed with
  live receipts tied to accepted mains.
- The product can be disabled/removed without disabling the empty provider core.
