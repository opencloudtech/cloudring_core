# G22 — One-engineer operations and autonomous recovery

## Outcome

Consolidate the operability already built into G01-G21 and prove one trained
engineer can run the integrated platform in normal conditions within the measured
toil budget. This goal removes cross-product gaps; it is not the first time
individual components receive telemetry, backup or repair behavior.

All reusable implementation must merge into public OSS and the exact accepted
change must be deployed and live-verified at `https://hub.cloudring.org`.

## Scope

- Unify existing SLOs, dashboards, alerts, dependency health, GitOps drift,
  capacity, backup freshness, certificates, versions, incidents and risk in one
  operator console/CLI.
- Correlate OpenTelemetry signals, operations, audit and product state with
  cardinality/privacy budgets and no tenant-data leakage.
- Close diagnosis/repair gaps through explainable preflight, guided reversible
  repair, post-checks and privacy-safe support bundles.
- Consolidate certificate/credential rotation, restore rehearsal, storage scrub,
  node maintenance, capacity forecast and release qualification automation.
- Verify overload protection, maintenance modes and priority for system recovery
  across all products.
- Add SafePush runner-manager recovery, SNI/certificate rotation and signed-canary
  runbook with a measured recovery objective.
- Measure the operator profile and incident set in `MEASUREMENT_CONTRACT.md`, then
  remove recurring toil until targets pass.

## Required journeys

- diagnose/repair the full measurement incident set using shipped tooling/docs;
- rotate every supported credential/certificate without exposing secrets or
  losing accepted operations;
- perform node/product maintenance and verify cumulative user journeys;
- overload one tenant/product and preserve system/other-tenant SLOs;
- forecast/expand capacity through a reviewed plan;
- recover the isolated SafePush path from a clean manager bootstrap;
- complete 14-day healthy-state toil measurement and independent walkthrough.

## Hub and downstream delivery

Deploy the integrated operator experience to the hub and exercise bounded test
failures. CloudLinux uses the same diagnostics/automation and supplies only
alert routing, ownership and site bindings.

## Acceptance

- All critical alerts have owner, impact, runbook and resolution signal.
- Automation is scoped, approved, idempotent, audited and rollback-capable.
- Independent operator meets daily-toil, diagnostic and incident targets.
- Telemetry failure cannot stop the platform or create false green health.
