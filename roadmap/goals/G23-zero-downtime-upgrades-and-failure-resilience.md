# G23 — Zero-downtime upgrades and failure resilience

## Outcome

Run the integrated campaign proving the single-region platform and every product
survive supported failures and upgrades with zero release downtime, no data loss,
no duplicate operations and no invalid billing. Individual HA/upgrade behavior
was implemented earlier; this goal proves the system as a whole.

All reusable implementation must merge into public OSS and the exact accepted
change must be deployed and live-verified at `https://hub.cloudring.org`.

## Scope

- Finalize release/version policy, N/N-1 matrix, OCS candidate compatibility,
  deprecation, expand/migrate/contract and rollback boundaries.
- Consolidate progressive rolling/blue-green traffic shift, automated acceptance,
  abort and rollback across core and independently versioned products.
- Audit all production claims for replica/quorum/topology/headroom and remediate
  any remaining single-instance dependency.
- Run pre-upgrade backup/restore validation and continuous measurement using
  actual signed adjacent prereleases, never two workspace builds.
- Execute one-server-loss, control-plane API, PostgreSQL, OpenBao, network,
  storage, VM, managed Kubernetes, object, backup and connector drills.
- Keep continuous login/session refresh, IAM decisions, usage ingest, rating,
  balanced ledger and invoice-read probes running through replica loss and the
  signed N-1-to-N release.
- Lose the management plane while existing data planes run, then reconcile all
  accepted operations, usage and audit on recovery.

## Required journeys

1. Install signed G22 prerelease, create representative resources/usage and
   upgrade core/products to signed G23 candidate under one-second probes.
2. Fail a canary and prove automatic rollback before wider exposure.
3. Exercise rollback before and restore/recovery after the documented irreversible
   migration boundary.
4. Remove/reboot one eligible server and prove direct IPv4/IPv6, portal/API,
   PostgreSQL, VM, product, usage and audit continuity plus cleanup.
5. Fail secret, database, storage, network and remote connector components in
   separate bounded drills.
6. Verify cumulative G00-G22 journeys after every recovery.

## Hub and downstream delivery

Run the complete campaign on the exact Enterprise main at the hub with approved
mutation tuples and dedicated data. Generic defects return to OSS. Provider runs
the full non-destructive campaign and prepares site mutation inputs; its real
failure campaign completes in G24.

## Acceptance

- Zero-downtime, RPO/RTO and soak definitions in the measurement contract pass.
- Tasks 21-24 are freshly re-proved against final product paths.
- Issues #81, #82, #33 and #84 close only after their observer, recovery,
  one-server-loss and supported-version criteria pass this integrated campaign.
- CDN/DNS fallback never substitutes for a required direct-origin proof.
- Rollback, cleanup, drift and cumulative regression are green.
