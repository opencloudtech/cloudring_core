# G01 — Disposable public development installation

## Outcome

From a fresh public clone, a contributor or product team can create and destroy a
real isolated CloudRING development environment with one supported command. It is
safe, observable and useful for integration testing, but is unmistakably not a
production topology.

All reusable implementation must merge into public OSS and the exact accepted
change must be deployed and live-verified in an isolated scope beside
`https://hub.cloudring.org`.

## Scope

- Publish pinned prerequisites and a reproducible local/CI profile using a
  supported disposable Kubernetes environment.
- Implement `validate`, `create`, `status`, `diagnose`, `reset` and `destroy` with
  deterministic plans, idempotency, timeouts, cancellation and cleanup receipts.
- Install the real management-plane binaries, schemas, migrations, API and portal
  shell; do not replace them with fake backends.
- Supply development-only identity, storage and secret bindings that are clearly
  namespaced, non-production and impossible to select in a production profile.
- Run the same public APIs and extension points intended for production.
- Generate privacy-safe diagnostics and teardown all owned resources, volumes,
  credentials, processes and network artifacts.

## Required journeys

1. Start on a clean machine/repository, validate prerequisites, create the
   environment and observe the empty-provider readiness shell.
2. Re-run create and prove no unintended change.
3. Restart platform processes and recover durable development state.
4. Execute positive and negative API/CLI smoke tests with the bounded development
   operator identity.
5. Destroy, verify zero owned residue, then recreate from the same inputs.
6. Follow the public tutorial from a CloudLinux-controlled clean-room CI job using
   no Enterprise checkout or unpublished local module.

## Hub and downstream delivery

Run the disposable profile in a dedicated namespace/cell and non-customer
hostname beside the hub; it must have no ownership over current production
resources. Both downstreams pin the public release and run create/status/destroy
in CI. No development credential or data is copied into production evidence.

## Acceptance

- The complete journey meets the installation/DX measurement profile.
- Production validation rejects every development-only shortcut.
- Public issue #32 is partially satisfied for development; production closure
  waits for G02.
- The signed G01 prerelease is reproducible and its destroy receipt is green.

## Non-goals

HA, customer identities and sellable products are not claimed. The environment is
a real integration system, not production evidence.
