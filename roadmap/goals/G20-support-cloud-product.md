# G20 — Support cloud product

## Outcome

Make customer support a first-class OCS product: entitlement-aware cases,
privacy-safe diagnostics, bounded collaboration and a durable incident timeline
instead of ad hoc access and untraceable messages.

All reusable implementation must merge into public OSS and the exact accepted
change must be deployed and live-verified at `https://hub.cloudring.org`.

## Scope

- Define support offering/entitlement, case, severity, SLA clock, resource link,
  consent, escalation, diagnostic request, collaboration, resolution and
  retention contracts.
- Generate redacted support bundles with manifest, digest, provenance, size/
  cardinality limits and source-safety validation.
- Integrate G19 controlled access for bounded diagnostic sessions; support can
  never mint hidden or longer-lived access.
- Implement tenant/provider comments/events, status, SLA alerts, ownership,
  handoff, escalation and immutable audit.
- Support external ticket-routing adapters without making a proprietary system a
  core dependency.
- Provide customer/provider API, CLI, portal extension, observability,
  backup/restore, upgrade/rollback and secure retention/deletion.

## Required journeys

- open entitled case, attach resources, request/consent to diagnostics, collect
  bundle, grant/revoke access, escalate, resolve and retain/delete by policy;
- reject cross-tenant case/resource/bundle access and unsupported entitlement;
- fail external routing and continue durable local support operation;
- generate a source-safe bundle under five minutes with no secret/private data;
- restore case/audit state and prove no access grant is resurrected;
- meter/rate a paid support offering without corrupting SLA clocks.

## Hub and downstream delivery

Install the OSS product at the hub with an isolated support route and test tenant.
Enterprise and CloudLinux supply routing/ownership and jurisdictional retention
configuration only. Complete cleanup preserves only policy-required audit.

## Acceptance

- Support cannot bypass G05 IAM or G19 access policy.
- Every critical case has owner, clock, escalation and externally visible state.
- Diagnostic redaction is machine-tested and fail-closed.
- External routing outage does not lose or duplicate a case.
