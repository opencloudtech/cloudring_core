# G27 — Final security, compliance and CloudRING 1.0 release

## Outcome

After all functionality exists, perform the broad adversarial review, fix every
release blocker and publish the standalone platform plus OCS 1.0 as a
reproducible, supportable release for independent providers. Multi-region and
federation remain explicit post-1.0 tracks and are not release dependencies.

All reusable fixes must merge into public OSS and the final accepted release must
be deployed and live-verified at `https://hub.cloudring.org`.

## Scope

- Freeze features and audit every G00-G24 requirement, issue-map row,
  `LEGACY_WORK_MAP.md` obligation and capability-matrix cell. No required item may
  be silently moved outside 1.0.
- Threat-model provider, tenant, product, browser, agent, supply chain, operator,
  connector, federation-ready schema boundaries, billing, backup and recovery.
- Run deep code/security, SAST, dependency/vulnerability, secret/source-safety,
  fuzz/race, RBAC, network, container, IaC, provenance, licence and boundary audits.
- Test real-runtime authentication, authorization, isolation, confused deputy,
  SSRF, injection, replay, CSRF, session, break-glass and package sandbox
  negatives. Verify that disabled federation surfaces cannot create an exposure
  or standalone dependency; live federation security belongs to G26's later
  release gate.
- Audit GDPR/data-residency engineering controls, retention/deletion, access
  review, audit integrity, incident response and DPA-ready documentation without
  claiming legal certification not granted by an authority.
- Fix release-blocking findings in OSS first, propagate pins, redeploy all
  providers and rerun affected and cumulative gates. Risk acceptance cannot waive
  a critical/high exploitable issue, secret/public-boundary breach, tenant escape,
  data-loss path or broken release provenance.
- Freeze OCS 1.0 from the release candidate only after real Network, Volume,
  Image, VM and one remote/API-only product plus two provider implementations
  pass positive, negative, lifecycle and upgrade compatibility. The standard's
  mandatory API, optional microfrontend and local/remote/API-only profiles must
  share one canonical validator.
- Publish docs, compatibility/support matrix, migrations, threat model, runbooks,
  SDKs, conformance, images/packages, SBOM, provenance, signatures and source tag.

## Required final proof

- clean-clone empty provider and every reference product through OCS;
- complete human/API/CLI/scoped-agent parity and audit;
- one-server-loss, database/storage/network/secret failover, off-cell restore and
  zero-downtime signed N-1-to-N upgrade;
- continuous platform API, portal, ID, IAM, usage ingest, rating, ledger and
  invoice-read correctness through replica loss and the signed upgrade;
- Enterprise reproducibly serves the hub from exact final pin;
- CloudLinux clean-room site installs, operates, backs up/restores, upgrades/
  rolls back and removes the provider plane and one CloudLinux-owned OCS product
  using only released OSS, Provider, SafePush and CloudLinux infrastructure;
- all exact CI/protection/SafePush checks green; no required open issue,
  unclassified WIP, duplicate, placeholder, private dependency or hidden step.

## Release acceptance

- Ledger contains no required blocked/unverified item. The only architectural
  expansion tracks outside 1.0 are G25 multi-region and G26 opt-in federation;
  they cannot satisfy or waive a standalone release requirement.
- Capability matrix proves every applicable runtime, data, IAM, UX, billing,
  observability, HA, backup, upgrade, test, docs and live cell.
- Measurement objectives pass with immutable candidate artifacts.
- A real signed tag, SBOM and provenance verify from a fresh environment.
- Final public/Enterprise/Provider SHAs, pins, GitOps revisions, artifacts,
  cleanup and support handoff are recorded without secrets.

## Completion statement

Only after findings are fixed and every final proof passes may CloudRING 1.0 be
released for production use by independent providers. Green CI, a live hub or a demo
alone is insufficient.
