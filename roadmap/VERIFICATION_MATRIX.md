# Roadmap verification matrix

This file turns the terminal roadmap goals into executable QA contracts. Angle-
bracket values are not loose placeholders: the matching `roadmap/state/GNN.json`
must resolve them to exact accepted SHAs, immutable artifact digests, target IDs,
evidence paths and freshness windows before a command runs. A command surface
missing when its owning goal starts is an implementation blocker, not an excuse
to substitute prose or synthetic evidence.

## Common release checks

| Check | Command or authority | Expected machine result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Roadmap graph and requirements | `go run ./cmd/cloudring-roadmap verify --root ./roadmap` | `cloudring_roadmap_verified goals=28 requirements=28`; the graph, requirement ownership and 1.0/post-1.0 boundary are valid |
| Go correctness | `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` | exit 0 on the exact accepted public source SHA |
| Static analysis | `go vet ./...` | exit 0 on the exact accepted public source SHA |
| Source safety | `go run ./cmd/cloudring-sourcecheck scan --scope changed` | exit 0, no finding and no secret/private-source output |
| Protected delivery | Hosted required-check readback for each exact main SHA | every required check terminal-success; no skipped/bypassed check |
| Downstream pins | `git ls-tree <accepted-downstream-sha> cloudring_core` | both consumer mains point to the same accepted public commit |
| Hub regression | `go run ./cmd/cloudringctl verify alpha-live --hub-url https://hub.cloudring.org/ --api-health-url https://api.cloudring.org/healthz --evidence <sanitized-evidence>` | exit 0; Hub HTTP 200, API `status=ready`, exact GitOps revision and cumulative journeys green |

## G00-G23 executable goal contracts

The command shown in each row is a **required public interface**, not a claim
that it exists in the current tree. Before a goal may change from `not_started`,
public OSS must implement and test that exact stable interface (or version the
row and requirement first). If the command is absent, unstable, or cannot
resolve the goal state, the goal is `blocked`; operators may not replace it with
an ad hoc script, prose review, fixture-only result, or a downstream-only tool.

Every invocation consumes `roadmap/state/GNN.json`. That state must resolve all
angle-bracket values to exact public, Enterprise and Provider main SHAs and pins;
immutable artifact and release-manifest digests; deployment fingerprints and
GitOps revisions; protected evidence locators; freshness/retention; rollback;
and cleanup. The standard success JSON is
`{"goal":"GNN","requirement":"CR-GNN-*","verdict":"pass","exactTupleBound":true,"cleanup":"pass"}`
plus the goal fields below. Missing, stale, mismatched or unresolved input must
return non-zero and `verdict=blocked`; a negative fixture must return non-zero
with the exact rejected field.

“Ordered acceptance” means: OSS clean-room passes first; Enterprise passes at an
exact pin of that public SHA; Provider passes at the same public SHA without an
Enterprise dependency; then the hub passes at the exact accepted Enterprise
GitOps revision. Only that order can set the state to `delivered`. “Cumulative”
means the common release checks and every prior delivered goal's signed terminal
journeys are rerun against the new tuple, with the receipt bound through
`predecessorRegression`.

## G24 portable-provider certification

Prerequisites: G23 delivered, two isolated downstream checkouts, an approved
independent-site environment, protected inventory, off-cell backup target and an
exact live mutation envelope.

1. Run the common checks in the public, OpenCloudTech consumer and independent
   provider consumer repositories.
2. Run `go run ./cmd/cloudringctl verify production-ovh` against the accepted
   OpenCloudTech source. Expected: exit 0 and all structural/live-applicable
   checks ready without private implementation in public core.
3. Run the Provider SafePush Stage 9 pipeline on its exact main. Expected: a
   verified signed receipt binding provider main, public pin, protected inputs
   and all required jobs; no fixture-only qualification.
4. Execute the stable install, backup/restore, signed N-1-to-N upgrade/rollback,
   one-server-loss and cleanup commands delivered by G02/G22/G23 on the
   independent site. Expected state fields: `install=verified`,
   `restore=verified`, `upgradeContinuity=verified`, `singleServerLoss=verified`,
   `cleanup=verified`, with RPO/RTO and continuity measurements inside policy.
5. Build and operate one independently owned OCS product using released public
   SDK/artifacts only. Expected: conformance, lifecycle, billing-policy, support,
   upgrade and removal receipts verify with no Enterprise dependency.

## G27 final security, compliance and CloudRING 1.0 release

Prerequisites: G00-G24 delivered, feature freeze, immutable candidate artifacts,
fresh hub and independent-provider baselines, and a complete finding ledger.

1. Run all common checks plus the repository's deep security, fuzz, dependency,
   provenance, licence, IaC and boundary jobs on the immutable candidate.
2. Run `go run ./cmd/cloudringctl iteration gate --report <sanitized-report>`.
   Expected: exit 0, every G00-G24 requirement result `accepted`, no unresolved
   release blocker, exact public/consumer pins, fresh evidence and
   `mutationAllowed=true`.
3. Run continuous login/session, IAM allow/deny, lifecycle operation, usage
   ingest/rating/ledger/invoice-read and audit probes during one-server loss and
   a signed N-1-to-N upgrade. Expected: zero release-attributable eligible-request
   failures, lost/duplicate accepted work, authorization fail-open, unbalanced
   ledger or invalid invoice.
4. Re-run Network, Volume, Image, VM and the real remote/API-only reference
   product through the same canonical OCS validator, runtime conformance and
   upgrade suite. Expected: all positive fixtures/products pass and every
   negative fixture fails on its exact machine-readable field.
5. Verify signed release tag, SBOM, provenance, compatibility/support matrix and
   clean-clone installation. Expected terminal verdict:
   `cloudring1_0=release_approved`; any accepted risk outside the published policy
   or any missing proof yields `release_blocked`.

## Post-1.0 G25 and G26

G25 and G26 cannot satisfy or block G27. Before either changes to `in_progress`,
it must add and test a stable `cloudringctl verify` command whose JSON binds the
exact standalone 1.0 base, target topology, workload/measurement profile,
failure/partition actions, rollback and cleanup. G25 must prove independent cell
and real-region behavior. G26 must prove opt-in bilateral trust,
partition/reconciliation, local autonomy and that removing any directory,
coordinator, provider or trust relationship cannot disable standalone providers
or unrelated peers. Each track ends with its own broad security review, fixes and
full regression before release promotion.

### G26 private-to-public peak-capacity terminal journey

Run the G26 federation verifier against two independently administered providers
and a capacity-constrained private workload. Its terminal JSON must bind the
exact standalone 1.0 base and both provider SHAs/trust revisions; immutable quote
and bilateral-consent IDs; residency, identity/IAM, quota/capacity and cost-policy
decisions; remote reservation and lifecycle operations; accepted usage,
reconciliation and adapter-ready settlement totals; injected failure actions,
compensating rollback, drain/deprovision and cleanup receipts. Expected:
`privatePublicBurst=verified`, every accepted operation is applied exactly once,
the financial ledgers balance, every rejected/failed phase leaves no unauthorized
resource or charge, and the private provider plus unrelated peers remain usable.
